## Brief
We have been tasked to build an app which uses the crud methodology meaning to create, read, update and delete features on this application. 
I have decided to build a Blog Webpage which will incorporate all of these features. You will be able to once registered and logged in
to be able to create posts, read posts, update posts and delete the posts. This will be using a one to many database relationship. 



### My Approach
To achieve this, I have created a User app and blog post app this will:
* Create a user account (satisfies 'Create') that stores:
   * *User Name*
   * *First and Last Name*
   * *Email*
   * *Password*
* Create all different types of posts
   * *Title* of the post
   * *Date and time* that the post was made
   *
* View and update their account details (satisfies 'Read' and 'Update')
* Delete their account (satisfies 'Delete')
* Read blog they and other users have created (satisfies 'Read':


They are then able to log in or register an account:

login (https://github.com/Nige72/project/blob/main/static/images/login.png)

Once they are logged in, they now have access to the 'dashboard' page and their account page:

Navigating to the 'Add Blog' page allows them to post a blog which will then appear on the posts page:

posts (https://github.com/Nige72/project/blob/main/static/images/posts.png)


Navigating to the 'Dashboard' page allows them to view their account details, update them and delete the account if they so desire.
